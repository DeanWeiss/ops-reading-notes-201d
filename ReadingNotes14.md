# How to remove malware from your Windows PC

1. Disconnect your PC from the internet and Enter Safe Mode
2. Delete temporary files via DiskCleanup.
3. Run your malware scanner
4. Run a scan with Malwarebytes
5. Fix your web browser
6. Recover your files if Windows is corrupt
7. Keep your PC Clean. Do this by making sure it's updated, have your antivvirus on and do periodic checks.
