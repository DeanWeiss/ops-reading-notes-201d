# System Log Analysis, Registry, Control Panel

The Windows Registry is a database where Windows and many programs store their configuration settings. You can edit the registry yourself to enable hidden features and tweak specific options. These tweaks are called "registry hacks."

In Windows 10 and 7 the registry are stored in files. C:\Windows\System32\Config\. Each user account also has it's own NTUSER.dat file that can't be edited directly.

Some things can only be changed by finding 'registry hacks'. Other settings are available in Group Policy. 

Editing a registry isn't dangerous if you know what you are doing. But, if you go in and just start messing around you could mess up your systems configuration and even render Windows unbootable.

To edit a registry  "you’ll open the Registry Editor application. To do so, press Windows+R to open the Run dialog. Type “regedit” and then press Enter. You can also open the Start menu, type “regedit.exe” into the search box, and press then Enter.

You’ll be asked to agree to a User Account Control prompt before continuing. This gives the Registry Editor the ability to modify system settings.

Navigate to whatever key you need to modify in the left pane. You’ll know where you need to be because the instructions for the registry hack you’re trying to apply will tell you.

On Windows 10, you can also just copy-paste an address into the Registry Editor’s address bar and press Enter.

To change a value, double-click it in the right pane and enter the new value. Sometimes, you’ll need to create a new value—right-click in the right pane, select the type of value you need to create, and then enter the appropriate name for it. In other cases, you may need to create new keys (folders). The registry hack will tell you what you need to do.

You’re done. You can click “OK” to save your change and close the Registry Editor. You’ll sometime need to reboot your PC or sign out and sign back in for your change to take effect, but that’s it.

That’s all performing a registry hack involves—you’ve now opened the Registry Editor, located the value you want to change, and changed it."

## Things I want to know more about
  I'd like to mess around and see what you can actually do and how hackers might use your registry file against you.
