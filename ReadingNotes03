The Help Desk is often the 'face' of the IT staff and so customers will make their impressions about the organization based on the Help Desk.

It is most often that the Help Desk is the first line of support for users. When a user has a problem, this is who will provide assistance first and then decide if the problem needs to be elevated to a higher tier. Strong communication skills are necessary to communicate with customers who are often less IT savy.
