 #### Why Use pfSense?
  It is fast, free and stable. It is highly customizable, giving you full control of the components you want.
  
 #### Embedded Installation
  It can also be installed on several different embedded platforms; Pc-Engines, Soekris, Alix and others.
  
  Embedded installs create small, quiet, low power appliance to run on your network. It looks more professional to set up an embedded pfSense device rather than an entire PC. 
  
  The embedded version is different than the PC version. It has been tweaked to extend the life of the storage media.
  
  #### Getting Started with pfSense and Support
    A computer with at least two network cards installed, free support is available through the forums, mailing list and also on IRC. BSH Perimeter, the company that founded pfSense also offers commercial support, which is designed for users running pfSense in an enterprise environment.
  
  A one-year support subscription includes five hours of support that can be used for configuration questions, network design, migrations to pfSense , as other issues you may encounter.

Commercial support subscribers also gain access to the automatic configuration backup utility which can automatically backup the configuration of your pfSense system. You also get online access to the pfSense book.


## Things I want to know more about
  If the computer doesn't have two network cards installed, can it be virtually faked? What other specs are optimal for the computer, RAM, CPU, memory? Is this compatible with all IP's?
