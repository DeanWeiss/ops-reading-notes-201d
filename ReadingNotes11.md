# SSD Recovery Best Practices
Common Indicators that the SSD could be failing
-Bad Blocks: Storage segments that, through memory corruption or physical dmage, impede data storage and retrieval functions.
    - Saving,reading and moving files may result in failure. Active applications may result in failure or be very slow. 
  - The best thing to do is to run a software that can search for such defects.
- File System Repair: This could be an issue with the connector port. You can try to repair this. 
- Crashing: If the system crashes repeatedly during start up but then eventually runs normal, this could be the SSD slowly failing. There are software that can be run to detect this. You may need to reinstall your OS after you've cleared all of your data, though this fix is likely only short term.
- Read Only Mode: Less common, SSDs may work in a read-only mode, this means that it is likely corrupted.

No matter what, you will always want to back up your data!!!!

## Things I want to know more about

I have never had RAM fil me, I am wondering what the difference is in longevity for the different types of RAM out there. If being DDR 3 or DD4 makes a difference?
